A *Player* _rolls a six-sided die_, _ending the turn_ if the result is 1,
with no _points earned_ for that _turn_.
Otherwise, the player _decides_ whether to roll again or to _hold_.
On holding, the sum of all rolls for that turn are _added to the players score_.
If number of players == 1, the *Game* is over after 7 turns, with the goal of
maximizing the score.
If number of players > 1, the Game is when any player's score is >= 100, making
that player _win the game_.
Run a *Simulation* with *Players with different strategies* and record the success rate
  (max score or %wins against others)

Decisions/Assumptions:
  Two different versions of game or a _single one_ that is based on number of players?

Responsibilities:
  Player:
      Track total score
      When prompted to start the turn, roll the die
      End turn on a 1, without adding to score
      Track turn score
      Decide to roll again or hold
      Signal end of a turn to Game


  Game:
    Decide behavior based on number of players
    Tell player to start a new turn
    Track number of turns taken
    Collect score of player(s)
    Declare a winner if mulitplayer
    Declare game over if single player after n turns

  Simulation
    Run a number of games with a number of players
    Collect statistics on win percentage (multiplayer) or max score(single player)
